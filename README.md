# Game Dev Diary

This is where the static-y content of [Game Dev Diary](https://gamediary.dev)
lives! It's also where you can learn how to use
[Diary Generator](https://github.com/Mathspy/diary-generator) by example!

There really isn't anything interesting in this repository besides the bestest
logo made by my dear friend (thank you again, N!) and a bunch of static HTML and
CSS files.

Feel free to take inspiration from this repository for how to start your own
diary, and if you do, please do share it with me! ❤️

One side note of interest, this repository collaborates with
[Mathspy/diary-generator-worker](https://github.com/Mathspy/diary-generator-worker)
to ensure the diary is always up to date.

- A rebuild automatically happens from
  [CloudFlare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) if any new static content is
  pushed to this repo
- A rebuild automatically happens if a new release of
  [Diary Generator](https://github.com/Mathspy/diary-generator) is published to
  ensure the diary is using the latest and greatest in diary generation
  witchcraft
- A rebuild automatically happens every day at 00:00 to catch any new entries
  that should be published!

All I have to do is write in Notion and let the automation do the rest ❤️
